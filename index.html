                <p>This laboratory manual is curated by students of the the PSPE program in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from the College of Engineering at Texas Tech University. Our mission is to provide a platform where students can actively participate in the betterment and growth of safety culture by allowing them give feedback in the form of a GIT reository hosted by GitHub Pages.</p>
                <h3 id="student">To the Student</h3>
                <p>The following are hyperlinks to the general topics a testing student in the PSPE lab needs to know:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="#s11"  class="visible-link">What training do I need to complete?</a></li>

                <h3 id="contribute">Contribute</h3>
                <p>This laboratory safety manual is a living document and requires constant revision and feedback from students. The PSPE Lab Safety Program is a student maintained effort and any member who wishes to sustain and improve the program are encouraged to do so.</p>
                <h4>How to contribute.</h4>
                <p>The PSPE Lab Safety Manual forms the backbone of the safety program. The document uses GitHub to control changes and contributions from students. Students can make a pull request, make changes, and push changes to the repository. The Laboratory Safety Captain then decides whether to accept the changes and merge the changes to the master branch.</p>
                <p>Students who wish to contribute should become familiar with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The document itself.</li>
                    <li>The reference material.</li>
                    <li>GitHub and GIT version control.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>One should always know the ratings of the device under test and should make adjustments before applying voltage to a device.</li>
                    <li>Exploding components (especially electrolytic capacitors) and arcing circuits can cause blindness and severe burns.</li>
                    <li>Components that arc can cause fires and should be avoided.</li>
                    <li>A emergency stop switch should be included in any power supplied circuit so that when opened, the switch will de-energize the entire setup. Place these switches so that you can reach them quickly in case of emergency, and without reaching across hot or high voltage components.</li>
                    <li class="emphasis">Always turn off equipment when you exit the laboratory. </li>

                <h3 id = "s35" class="title">Hand Drill</h3>
                <p>This equipment has the following hazards:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="emphasis">High Speed Rotating Equipment (PPE Needed: Safety Glasses or Side Shields)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following safety practices are required in addition to the general lab safety requirements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always know the properties of the material to be drilled. The density, thickness of sheet, and porousness of the material can effect the performance of the drill and the bit needed for the job.</li>
                    <li>All work should be secured to the table when drilling. In general, if the drill is capable of spinning the material towards the operator it should be secured.</li>
                    <li>When drilling on a bench be sure the drill bit will not drill into the table surface. This can be avoided by securing a scrap piece of material underneath the material to be drilled or by ensuring the drilled hole will be off the table.</li>
                    <li>Make adjustments and change the drill bits only when the drill safety is on, or if it is a corded drill, with the cord unplugged.</li>
                    <li>Battery powered drills have limited current, and limited torque. Corded drills have an almost unlimited current, and thus have more torque.</li>
                    <li>When drilling with a corded drill; use caution and accelerate the drill slowly. It has the ability to injury your wrist if the flute of the drill becomes stuck.</li>
                    <li>If a drill begins to twist your hand release the trigger and remove your hand to avoid injury.</li>
                    <li>When drilling with a cordless drill be careful not to overheat the drill and be sure to place the battery on it's charger when finished.</li>
                    <li>The proper way to hold and drill is with the trigger hand connected to the trigger and your other hand on the back base of the drill to guide and provide steady pressure to the surface of the material being drilled.</li>
                    <li>Do not attempt to make a smaller hole larger by wallowing it out, this damages the flute of the bit and will likely cause wrist and hand injury when the material catches the flute and twists the drill from the operator's hands.</li>
                    <li>When drilling deep holes withdraw the bit several times to clear the drilled area of debris inside the hole.</li>
                    <li class="emphasis">When using any rotating apparatus; hair, loose-clothing, and jewelry should be removed before operating.</li>
                    <li class="emphasis">As with any machine if you are unsure how to use it in a safe way ask for help.</li>

                <p>The following safety practices are required in addition to the general lab safety requirements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not operate this instrument in the presence of flammable gases or fumes. Operation of an electrical instrument in such an environment constitutes a definite safety risk.</li>
                    <li>Disconnect the power cord before removing the instrument covers when replacing components. Under certain conditions, even when if the power cable is removed, dangerous voltages may exist. To avoid injuries, always disconnect the power and discharge circuits before handling or adjusting.</li>
                    <li>Wear safety glasses when working with a circuit at high power or high voltage.</li>
                    <li>Use rubber floor mats (if available) to insulate yourself from ground, when working in the lab.</li>
                    <li>Do not exceed the limits of the device you are testing.</li>
                    <li>Make sure connections to terminals are secured properly.</li>
                    <li>Make sure the voltage adjustment knob is zeroed before operating.</li>
                    <li>Never modify a connection when the device is operating.</li>

##### Overview
This resource site is curated by the lab manager of the Program for Semiconductor Product Engineering Testing Lab in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Whitacre College of Engineering, Texas Tech University.
Our mission is to provide a simple and accessible way to reserve lab time for assignments and experiements.

##### Features
- Links to necessary training, resources, and guidelines for the laboratory
- Online access to our equipment datasheet database
- An weekly updated schedule of lab activity
- A google form that allows students to reserve time in the laboratory
- A feedback form for students to help improve the PSPE Testing Lab Student Portal

### New Students

1. Visit the New Student Portal to learn how the lab will operate.
2. Visit the Lab Safety Manual and follow instructions given for completing safety tests. Know the rules that you must abide by!
3. Develop a test plan for your assignment/project and use the Datasheets Reference page to look through the PSPE lab equipment available.
4. Look at what times have been reserved on the Schedule page and know what hours you want to reserve.

### Future Improvements
- All webpages will be refactored to make the style more consistent
- All CSS documents will be refactored to make the styling dry
- The site is not mobile friendly and will be refactored using Twitter's Bootstrap
- The google forms are a clunky way to handle requests, a JS form will be made instead
- A database will be made to handle online requests and our inventory
- An official website domain will be purchased and the website will no longer use GitHub Pages

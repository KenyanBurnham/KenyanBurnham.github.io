<div class="page-break"></div>

### Medical Emergency Guidance

> First aid treatment for the potential hazards of equipment in lab 252 that may cause bodily injury or chemical exposure should be known and employed in any medical emergency. __Always call *911* when a medical emergency occurs.__

 Situation | Response
 --- | ---
 Minor Injury | Seek to contain and seal the wound using wraps and bandages located in the medical kit.
 Vapor Exposure | Leave area and go outside for fresh air. Symptoms of any degree warrant calling 911. <br><br> If unsure of a suitable response to a specific agent call EH&S (Phone number located at the beginning of Section 1).
 Exposure to Liquid Chemical Agent | Follow instructions laid out in MSDS. (Located in Section __##__). Any present symptoms warrant calling 911. <br><br> If unsure of a suitable response to a specific agent call EH&S (Phone number located at the beginning of Section 1).
 Machine Injury | __TURN OFF THE MACHINE__ in every instance. Reduce blood loss by immediately beginning to wrapping area in absorbent and containing material that may be found in the medical kit. <br><br> If a member is separated do not try and reattach the severed member. <br><br> Immediately seek medical emergency assistance.  


<div class="page-break"></div>

### Fire Emergency Guidance
> *Even if one strongly suspects the alarm may be false, Texas Tech and the Fire Department of Lubbock assume every event is in fact real.*

###### If the building fire alarm sounds:
- Follow all emergency shut down procedures for your experiment.
- Exit the building through the nearest exit.

###### In the event that a fire is detected or suspected:
- All occupants of the building should evacuate immediately.
- If the alarm has not been sounded, the nearest fire alarm pull station should be activated.

###### In all cases immediately proceed to the Designated Outside Meeting Area (DOSMA).
- The DOSMA for lab 252 and the 253 workspace is to the West adjacent to the Linda and Terry Fuller Track and Field Complex located behind the Electrical and Computer Engineering building.

###### Situational Fire Responses:
Situation | Response
---|----
Caught in smoke | Drop to hands and knees and crawl towards nearest exit. <br> <br> Hold breath as much as possible; breathe through your nose and use shirt or cloth as a filter.
Trapped in a room. | Close as many doors as possible in between you and the fire.<br> <br> Wet and place cloth material around or under the door to help prevent smoke from entering the room.
 Clothing on fire.| Direct or assist a person to roll around on the floor to smother the flames. <br> <br> Only drench with water if safety shower is nearby.

<div class="page-break"></div>

### Electrocution Emergency Guidance

The following steps are to be followed in the event of an electrocution emergency:

 Step | Response  
--- | ---
 Approach | Call emergency responders as soon as possible. If a coworker trained in electrical emergency protocols is nearby, marshal their assistance immediately. <br><br> The approach to where a coworker has succumbed to electrical shock should be made cautiously to help ensure the current that incapacitated the victim does not harm you.
Examine | A quick look at the scene will reveal whether the victim remains in contact with the object inducing the electrical shock. Avoid nearby conductors and do not touch the victim until the electrical circuit that powers the area is de-energized.
De-Energize | If the only source of power to the victim's locale is a power cord to portable equipment, simply disconnect it at the power source. However, using an emergency stop button is also recommended. <br><br> For information regarding the safety switched located in 252/253 see the Emergency Response Equipment Location procedure.
Insulate | In the event that de-energization is impossible, the victim will need to be removed from the electrical source using an insulated material to move the victim without endangering the emergency respondent. <br><br> __DO NOT USE WOOD BROOM HANDLES__ to remove victims. They have a conductive finish and will only endanger emergency respondents.
Rescue | Do not touch electrocuted victims unless actively standing on an insulated material with the power source disconnected. If there is a risk of neck injury or contingency do not remove the victim at all. <br><br> Ensure the victim's airway is unobstructed, check pulse, and perform CPR if necessary. Use of an Automated Emergency Defibrillator (AED) is preferred. <br><br> You should not hesitate to use the AED even if you believe doing so might make the neck injury worse.

<div class="page-break"></div>

### Active Shooter Guidance

> If you witness an armed individual on campus at any time or if an individual is acting in a hostile or belligerent manner, immediately contact the Texas Tech Police at __*9-911*__ on a university phone or __*911*__ on mobile devices.

The following are guidelines for situations involving an active shooter:

Situation | Response
--- | ---
Armed subject outside building. | Turn off the lights. Close and lock all doors and windows. <br><br> If you can do so safely, move out of the line of fire. <br><br> Move to a core area of the building if it is safe to do so and remain there until the "all clear" instruction is given by the Texas Tech Police Department or a university authority. <br><br> If you doubt the authenticity or identity of the authority that is giving you instruction do not change your status.
Armed subject inside building.| If at all possible to flee the area safely and avoid danger, do so. <br><br> Contact the TTU Police Department immediately at __*743-2000*__ or __*9-911*__ with you location, if possible.<br><br> If flight is impossible, lock all doors and secure yourself in your space.<br><br> Get down on the floor or under a desk and remain silent. <br><br> Get out of the line of fire. <br><br> Wait for the "all clear" signal from the TTU Police Department.
Armed subject in workspace. | There is no procedure authorities can recommend in this situation. Do anything necessary to protect yourself. <br><br> Attempt to get the word out to others if possible, and call __*743-2000*__ or __*9-911*__ if practical and possible. <br><br> Use common sense. If hiding or fleeing is impossible, attempt to negotiate with the individual. <br><br> Attempting to overcome and armed subject with force is a last resort and should only be initiated in the most extreme of circumstances.


<div class="page-break"></div>

### Tornado Emergency Guidance

- Never modify a connection when the power supply is operating.

-----

#### Soldering Station

This equipment has the following hazards:
- __Burn Hazard__
- __Potential Lead Poisoning Hazard__
(PPE NEEDED: *Safety Glasses*)

*The following safety practices are required in addition to the general lab safety requirements.*
- Do not operate this instrument in the presence of flammable gases or fumes. Operation of an electrical instrument in such an environment constitutes a definite safety risk.
- Turn the soldering iron off when not in use. Leaving a hot iron can prevent a risk to peers and can damage the tip if it has not been correctly tinned.
- Always solder in a ventilated area and avoid inhaling.
- Lead-based solder can pose a lead poisoning risk. Always remember to wash hands thoroughly when finished.
- Eye protection should __always__ be worn when working with soldering stations.
- Always place iron or pencil in holder when not in use. Do not place a hot or cold pencil on any surface.
- Solder over the bench top to prevent hot solder from dropping on to the operator's legs.

-----

#### Hand Drill
This equipment has the following hazards:
- __High Speed Rotating Equipment__
(PPE NEEDED: *Safety Glasses or Side Shields*)

*The following safety practices are required in addition to the general lab safety requirements.*
- Always know the properties of the material to be drilled. The density, thickness of sheet, and porousness of the material can effect the performance of the drill and the bit needed for the job.
- All work should be secured to the table when drilling. In general, if the drill is capable of spinning the material towards the operator it should be secured.
- When drilling on a bench be sure the drill bit will not drill into the table surface. This can be avoided by securing a scrap piece of material underneath the material to be drilled or by ensuring the drilled hole will be off the table.
- Make adjustments and change the drill bits only when the drill safety is on, or if it is a corded drill, with the cord unplugged.
- Battery powered drills have limited current, and limited torque. Corded drills have an almost unlimited current, and thus have more torque.
    - When drilling with a corded drill; use caution and accelerate the drill slowly. It has the ability to injury your wrist if the flute of the drill becomes stuck.
    - If a drill begins to twist your hand release the trigger and remove your hand to avoid injury.
    - When drilling with a cordless drill be careful not to overheat the drill and be sure to place the battery on it's charger when finished.
- The proper way to hold and drill is with the trigger hand connected to the trigger and your other hand on the back base of the drill to guide and provide steady pressure to the surface of the material being drilled.
- Do not attempt to make a smaller hole larger by wallowing it out, this damages the flute of the bit and will likely cause wrist and hand injury when the material catches the flute and twists the drill from the operator's hands.
- When drilling deep holes withdraw the bit several times to clear the drilled area of debris inside the hole.
- __When using any rotating apparatus; hair, loose-clothing, and jewelry should be removed before operating.__
- As with any machine if you are unsure how to use it in a safe way __ask for help.__

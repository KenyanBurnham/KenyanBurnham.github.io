### Fire Emergency Guidance
> *Even if one strongly suspects the alarm may be false, Texas Tech and the Fire Department of Lubbock assume every event is in fact real.*

###### If the building fire alarm sounds:
- Follow all emergency shut down procedures for your experiment.
- Exit the building through the nearest exit.

###### In the event that a fire is detected or suspected:
- All occupants of the building should evacuate immediately.
- If the alarm has not been sounded, the nearest fire alarm pull station should be activated.

###### In all cases immediately proceed to the Designated Outside Meeting Area (DOSMA).
- The DOSMA for lab 252 and the 253 workspace is to the West adjacent to the Linda and Terry Fuller Track and Field Complex located behind the Electrical and Computer Engineering building.

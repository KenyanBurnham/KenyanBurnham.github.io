The following are guidelines for situations involving an active shooter:

Situation | Response
--- | ---
Armed subject outside building. | Turn off the lights. Close and lock all doors and windows. <br><br> If you can do so safely, move out of the line of fire. <br><br> Move to a core area of the building if it is safe to do so and remain there until the "all clear" instruction is given by the Texas Tech Police Department or a university authority. <br><br> If you doubt the authenticity or identity of the authority that is giving you instruction do not change your status.
Armed subject inside building.| If at all possible to flee the area safely and avoid danger, do so. <br><br> Contact the TTU Police Department immediately at __*743-2000*__ or __*9-911*__ with you location, if possible.<br><br> If flight is impossible, lock all doors and secure yourself in your space.<br><br> Get down on the floor or under a desk and remain silent. <br><br> Get out of the line of fire. <br><br> Wait for the "all clear" signal from the TTU Police Department.
Armed subject in workspace. | There is no procedure authorities can recommend in this situation. Do anything necessary to protect yourself. <br><br> Attempt to get the word out to others if possible, and call __*743-2000*__ or __*9-911*__ if practical and possible. <br><br> Use common sense. If hiding or fleeing is impossible, attempt to negotiate with the individual. <br><br> Attempting to overcome and armed subject with force is a last resort and should only be initiated in the most extreme of circumstances.

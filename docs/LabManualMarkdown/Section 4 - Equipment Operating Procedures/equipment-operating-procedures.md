### Equipment Operating Procedures

> The following are the generalized standard operating procedures for working with the equipment in the laboratory.

#### General Equipment Requirements

*The following safety practices are required in addition to the general lab safety requirements.*
- Power sources that are improvised or not factory standard should not be used.
- When working with voltages over 40V and current over 10A another person must be present.
- One should always know the ratings of the device under test and should make adjustments before applying voltage to a device.
- Exploding components (especially electrolytic capacitors) and arcing circuits can cause blindness and severe burns.
- Components that arc can cause fires and should be avoided.
- A emergency stop switch should be included in any power supplied circuit so that when opened, the switch will de-energize the entire setup. Place these switches so that you can reach them quickly in case of emergency, and without reaching across hot or high voltage components.
- __Always__ turn off equipment when you exit the laboratory. __Never__ leave any device unattended running.

#### Function Generator

This equipment has the following hazards:
- __High Voltages__

*The following safety practices are required in addition to the general lab safety requirements.*
- Do not operate this instrument in the presence of flammable gases or fumes. Operation of an electrical instrument in such an environment constitutes a definite safety risk.
- Disconnect the power cord before removing the instrument covers when replacing components. Under certain conditions, even when if the power cable is removed, dangerous voltages may exist. To avoid injuries, always disconnect the power and discharge circuits before handling or adjusting.
- Wear safety glasses when working with a circuit at high power or high voltage.
- Use rubber floor mats (if available) to insulate yourself from ground, when working in the lab.
- Make sure connections to terminals are secured properly.

#### Oscilloscope

This equipment has the following hazards:
- __High Voltages__

*The following safety practices are required in addition to the general lab safety requirements.*
- Use only isolated power sources (either isolated power supplies or AC power through isolated power transformers). This reduces possible risk by grounding the oscilloscope to a factory tested and approved source.
- Wear safety glasses when working with a circuit at high power or high voltage.
- Use rubber floor mats (if available) to insulate yourself from ground, when working in the lab.

#### Power Supply

This equipment has the following hazards:
- __High Voltages__

*The following safety practices are required in addition to the general lab safety requirements.*
- Do not operate this instrument in the presence of flammable gases or fumes. Operation of an electrical instrument in such an environment constitutes a definite safety risk.
- Disconnect the power cord before removing the instrument covers when replacing components. Under certain conditions, even when if the power cable is removed, dangerous voltages may exist. To avoid injuries, always disconnect the power and discharge circuits before handling or adjusting.
- Wear safety glasses when working with a circuit at high power or high voltage.
- Use rubber floor mats (if available) to insulate yourself from ground, when working in the lab.
- Do not exceed the limits of the device you are testing.
- Make sure connections to terminals are secured properly.
- Make sure the voltage adjustment knob is zeroed before operating.
- Never modify a connection when the power supply is operating.

#### Soldering Station

This equipment has the following hazards:
- __Burn Hazard__
- __Potential Lead Poisoning Hazard__
(PPE NEEDED: *Safety Glasses*)

*The following safety practices are required in addition to the general lab safety requirements.*
- Do not operate this instrument in the presence of flammable gases or fumes. Operation of an electrical instrument in such an environment constitutes a definite safety risk.
- Turn the soldering iron off when not in use. Leaving a hot iron can prevent a risk to peers and can damage the tip if it has not been correctly tinned.
- Always solder in a ventilated area and avoid inhaling.
- Lead-based solder can pose a lead poisoning risk. Always remember to wash hands thoroughly when finished.
- Eye protection should __always__ be worn when working with soldering stations.
- Always place iron or pencil in holder when not in use. Do not place a hot or cold pencil on any surface.
- Solder over the bench top to prevent hot solder from dropping on to the operator's legs.

#### Hand Drill
This equipment has the following hazards:
- __High Speed Rotating Equipment__
(PPE NEEDED: *Safety Glasses or Side Shields*)

*The following safety practices are required in addition to the general lab safety requirements.*
- Always know the properties of the material to be drilled. The density, thickness of sheet, and porousness of the material can effect the performance of the drill and the bit needed for the job.
- All work should be secured to the table when drilling. In general, if the drill is capable of spinning the material towards the operator it should be secured.
- When drilling on a bench be sure the drill bit will not drill into the table surface. This can be avoided by securing a scrap piece of material underneath the material to be drilled or by ensuring the drilled hole will be off the table.
- Make adjustments and change the drill bits only when the drill safety is on, or if it is a corded drill, with the cord unplugged.
- Battery powered drills have limited current, and limited torque. Corded drills have an almost unlimited current, and thus have more torque.
    - When drilling with a corded drill; use caution and accelerate the drill slowly. It has the ability to injury your wrist if the flute of the drill becomes stuck.
    - If a drill begins to twist your hand release the trigger and remove your hand to avoid injury.
    - When drilling with a cordless drill be careful not to overheat the drill and be sure to place the battery on it's charger when finished.
- The proper way to hold and drill is with the trigger hand connected to the trigger and your other hand on the back base of the drill to guide and provide steady pressure to the surface of the material being drilled.
- Do not attempt to make a smaller hole larger by wallowing it out, this damages the flute of the bit and will likely cause wrist and hand injury when the material catches the flute and twists the drill from the operator's hands.
- When drilling deep holes withdraw the bit several times to clear the drilled area of debris inside the hole.
- __When using any rotating apparatus; hair, loose-clothing, and jewelry should be removed before operating.__
- As with any machine if you are unsure how to use it in a safe way __ask for help.__

### Section 11 of University Chemical Hygiene Plan Requirements For Laboratory Safety Manual


* __11.1__ The Laboratory Safety Plan is a document that  is specific to a particular laboratory. This document is to identify potential hazards in the laboratory and give guidance for laboratory personnel in the event of an incident. The most recent version of the Laboratory Safety Plan must be available in a hard copy. This document shall at minimum contain:
    * __11.1.1__ The laboratory locations that are covered in the plan;
    * __11.1.2__ Responsible party for the laboratory locations that are covered in the plan;
    * __11.1.3__ Emergency contact information for the responsible party for the laboratory locations including the DCHO’s contact information;
    * __11.1.4__ Location of (M)SDSs, University Chemical Hygiene Plan and any other laboratory documents;
    * __11.1.5__ Rules and policies of the laboratory that are not less stringent than the CHP;
    * __11.1.6__ Identification of hazards in the laboratory;
    * __11.1.7__ Clean-up procedures in case of a spill;
    * __11.1.8__ Guidance on what to do in an case of emergency (e.g. fire, medical emergency, severe weather, etc.);
    * __11.1.9__ SOPs generated for the laboratory;
    * __11.1.10__ Acknowledgement sheet that all individuals working in the laboratory are required to sign that states they have read and understand the plan and will follow what is outlined in the plan.
* __11.2__ Where hazardous chemicals are used in the workplace, the laboratory shall develop
and carry out the provisions of a written Laboratory Safety Plan which:
    * __11.2.1__ Informs employees and students of physical and health hazards associated with hazardous chemicals in that laboratory; and
    * __11.2.2__ Discloses the Permissible Exposure Limits that employees should keep exposures below.
* __11.3__ The Laboratory Safety Plan shall be readily available to employees, employee representatives, and regulatory agencies upon request.
* __11.4__ The Laboratory Safety Plan shall include each of the following elements and shall indicate specific measures that the department will take to ensure laboratory employee protection:
    * __11.4.1__ Standard operating procedures incorporating safety and health considerations when laboratory work involves the use of hazardous chemicals and a waste stream analysis to determine what products are produced and how to properly dispose of them;
    * __11.4.2__ Criteria that the laboratory will use to determine and implement control measures for reducing employee exposure to hazardous chemicals including engineering controls, the use of personal protective equipment and hygiene practices giving particular attention to the selection of control measures for chemicals that are known to be extremely hazardous;
    * __11.4.3__ Requirements that laboratory hoods and other protective equipment are functioning properly and specific measures that shall be taken to ensure proper and adequate performance of such equipment;
    * __11.4.4__ Records of employee/student training;
    * __11.4.5__ The circumstances under which a particular laboratory operation, procedure, or activity shall require knowledge or presence of appropriate responder;
    * __11.4.6__ Provisions for medical consultation and medical examinations;
    * __11.4.7__ Designation of personnel responsible for implementation of the Laboratory Safety Plan; and
    * __11.4.8__ Provisions for additional employee protection for work with particularly hazardous substances. These include, but are not limited to, "select carcinogens”, reproductive toxins and substances which have a high degree of acute toxicity. Specific considerations shall be given to the following provisions which shall be included where appropriate:
        * __11.4.8.1__ Establishment of a designated area;
        * __11.4.8.2__ Use of containment devices such as laboratory hoods or glove boxes;
        * __11.4.8.3__ Procedures for safe removal of contaminated waste; and
        * __11.4.8.4__ Decontamination procedures.
* __11.5__ If dangerous activities are being conducted in the laboratory that require restricted
access;
    * __11.5.1__ A temporary sign must be posted on the door stating what activity is being conducted:
        * __11.5.1.1__ The sign must clearly state who is conducting the experiment:
        * __11.5.1.2__ The sign must have contact information of the individual(s) conducting the experiment;
        * __11.5.1.3__ The sign must state the start date/time and expected stop date/time of the experiment;
        * __11.5.1.4__ The sign must state specifically who is to have access to the laboratory;
        * __11.5.1.5__ The sign must state what additional PPE, engineering controls and    precautions must be used when entering the laboratory while the experiment is in progress.
    * __11.5.2__ The UCHO, DCHO, and Departmental Chair must be notified of what activities require restricted access.

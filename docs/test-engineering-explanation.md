### What is test engineering?

Semiconductor testing incorporates a variety of disciplines and each manufacturing process defines the professions by their own needs. Generally, testing engineering is broken into three different professions: _systems engineering_, _design engineering_, _product engineering_, and _test engineering_.

Each of these engineering professions is involved in the development and production of semiconductor devices, each profession entails a different set of tasks and responsibilities.

#### What is systems engineering?

A system engineer helps define the technical requirement for an of a new semiconductor product based on the needs given by the end-user. They are responsible for defining and documenting the customer’s requirements so that the rest of the engineering team can design and manufacture a working semiconductor device.

#### What is design engineering?

Once the system engineers define the technical requirements for a device design engineers develops the corresponding integrated circuit.

#### What is a test engineer?

Often, the device may not meet the exact customer expectations and requirements on its first production. The test engineer is responsible for characterizing the device to ensure it meets those specifications and to identify any flaws in the manufacturing process. The test engineer’s role is to generate the hardware and software needed to automate the testing process to guarantee the performance of the device after it’s fabrication.

#### What is a product engineer?

Once a manufacturing process for a device has been identified, the production engineer works to economize the process. Often production engineers and test engineers share dual responsibilities and roles.

The various roles in the design, development, and production process often overlap and are usually concurrent to one another, these definitions outline general functions the semiconductor industry needs to produce a high-quality product. The PSPE program provides a broad background in semiconductor technology; including testing, process, design, failure analysis, and business concepts.

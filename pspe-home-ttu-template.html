            <h2> Program for Semiconductor Product Engineering</h2>
            <p>The Texas Tech University College of Engineering Program for Semiconductor Product
               Engineering is an industry sponsored, Master's program to prepare students with bachelor's
               degrees in engineering and science for professional careers in semiconductor design
               and manufacturing. Students with bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering can
               earn Master of Science in Electrical Engineering degrees. One of the most exciting
               aspects of this program is that it is a true collaboration between the College of
               Engineering and many of the leading companies in the semiconductor industry.
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of the program is to help meet the enormous demand for trained semiconductor
               product engineers. The curriculum is designed to provide students with a working knowledge
               of both the theory and practice of semiconductor design and manufacturing. Students
               accepted into this two−year program take course work on the Tech campus for their
               first two semesters, then participate in an internship at one of the industry sponsors'
               facilities during the summer and one long semester, and then finish up their degrees
               with a long semester at Tech.
            </p>
            <p>Degree plans can be designed for either a Fall or Spring start. Working with the expert
               faculty at TTU in a state−of−the−art laboratory and in industrial facilities with
               industry mentors provides the student with the foundation necessary to make a positive
               contribution as a semiconductor product engineer immediately upon graduation.
             </p>

                </li>
                <li>The program emphasizes an integrated approach to problem solving and is supported
                   by major companies involved in semiconductor manufacturing and equipment.

            <h2>Features of this Innovative Program</h2>
            <p>The program provides a broad background
              in semiconductor technology, including testing, process, design, failure analysis,
              and business concepts. The program is supported by major companies involved in semiconductor

             <p>An industry internship is an integral part of the program. Much of the learning process
                occurs in a state−of−the−art laboratory facility dedicated to this program. Students
                in the program may come from a variety of undergraduate backgrounds in science and
                engineering with minimal leveling. The program emphasizes an integrated approach to
                problem solving. Students complete a project related to an industrial problem and
                are co−supervised by an industry mentor and a university professor. Students receive
                generous scholarships and other benefits while participating in the program.
